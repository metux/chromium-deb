chromium-browser (55.0.2883.75-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * External extensions are now disabled by default.  Chromium will only load
    extensions that are explicitly specified with the --load-extension command
    line option passed into CHROMIUM_FLAGS.  See the chromium-lwn4chrome
    package for an example of how to do this.
  * You can also use the --enable-remote-extensions command line argument to
    chromium, which will bypass this restriction.
